00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.040
My name is Margarita Manterola.


00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.625
I'm a Site Reliability
Engineer in the G Linux team.


00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:13.245
I'm very passionate about


00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.210
teaching programming
to everybody.


00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.760
I think it's very
important that everybody


00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.650
can learn how to tell
the computer what to do.


00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.370
One of the things
that really inspire


00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.110
me about the first
program was that it


00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:25.800
was targeted to people that


00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.740
were not from a computer
science background.


00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.000
As I myself don't


00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.665
come from a computer
science background,


00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:34.385
I felt really identified with
that and I wanted to help


00:00:34.385 --> 00:00:36.890
all these people keep
growing and keep


00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.680
learning and keep getting
more and more skills.


00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.270
So that's why I want


00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.325
this program to be
successful as well.


00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:45.575
I got involved in
developing this program


00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:47.825
early on because I
was really excited


00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.825
about being able to reach
thousands of learners


00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.160
and being able to help


00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.375
all these people
grow their skills.


00:00:54.375 --> 00:00:57.275
Working together with
people is really important.


00:00:57.275 --> 00:00:58.760
For this program, I


00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.800
collaborated with a ton
of different people.


00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.035
From people inside
Google, outside Google.


00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:05.270
I got reviews from people.


00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.290
I got new ideas.


00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.110
I think it's really important


00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.105
because it made the
scripts better.


00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.820
The reviewers
suggested new things


00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.040
that should be added
or pointed things that


00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.615
didn't make sense and I kept
incorporating the ideas


00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:22.030
into the scripts so that


00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.790
that the content delivered
was the best possible.


00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.470
If it had been just me,


00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:28.790
that wouldn't have been possible.


00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:29.990
It's really important to


00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.755
incorporate many
different points of view.


00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.225
It's been a lot of work,


00:01:34.225 --> 00:01:35.345
but I really enjoyed it.


00:01:35.345 --> 00:01:36.980
I enjoyed the process and it's


00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.275
really exciting to get
it to come to life.


00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:43.100
So I hope this program helps
people keep growing and


00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.110
keep expanding their
horizons so that they


00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.160
can reach their full potential.
